# AI Agent Intern - Technical Assessment Solution

**Communication Style Mimicking Agent for Mentor-Student Messaging System**

This project implements an AI agent that learns from and replicates user communication patterns in a mentor-student messaging context, as specified in the technical assessment requirements.

## üéØ Assessment Requirements Met

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements
1. **Style Mimicking Agent** - Analyzes mentor's communication patterns and generates authentic responses
2. **Context-Aware Responses** - Uses conversation history to provide relevant, helpful replies
3. **Event-Based Nudges** - Proactive follow-up messages based on student events

### ‚úÖ Nice-to-Have Features
- **Event Tracking** - Simulates student events (exams, assignments)
- **Proactive Messaging** - Contextual follow-up messages in mentor's style
- **Professional Implementation** - Clean, maintainable code with comprehensive logging

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application with UI
- `agents.py` - AI agent functions for style analysis and response generation
- `database.py` - SQLite database operations for sessions and styles
- `logging_config.py` - Comprehensive logging system
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## üß† Technical Approach

### Style Analysis Process
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes mentor's tone, vocabulary, message structure
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies common phrases, emoji usage, punctuation style
3. **Style Modeling**: Creates a communication fingerprint for the mentor
4. **Response Generation**: Uses learned patterns to generate authentic responses

### Context-Aware Response Generation
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple messages
- **Style Consistency**: Ensures responses match mentor's established patterns
- **Educational Value**: Provides helpful, accurate information in mentor's style

### Event-Based Nudging System
- **Event Simulation**: Tests scenarios like exam completion
- **Proactive Messaging**: Generates contextual follow-up messages
- **Style Integration**: Nudges match mentor's communication style

## üé≠ Mentor Personality Types

The system supports **4 distinct mentor personalities**, each based on **evidence-based teaching methodologies**:

### 1. **Encouraging Mentor** - Constructivist & Socratic Approach
- **Methodology**: Builds on prior knowledge, uses Socratic questioning
- **Teaching Style**: Scaffolding, positive reinforcement, active inquiry
- **Example**: *"Great question! This shows you're thinking critically. Let me build on what you already know - can you tell me what you've tried so far?"*

### 2. **Direct Mentor** - Mastery Learning & Deliberate Practice
- **Methodology**: Bloom's Taxonomy, worked examples, immediate feedback
- **Teaching Style**: Structured progression, competency-based advancement
- **Example**: *"Let's apply Bloom's Taxonomy here. First, understand the concept. Then, we'll apply it to solve real problems."*

### 3. **Academic Mentor** - Cognitive & Metacognitive Strategies
- **Methodology**: Zone of proximal development, cognitive load theory, metacognition
- **Teaching Style**: Explicit modeling, spaced repetition, systematic chunking
- **Example**: *"Let's apply constructivist principles here. What prior knowledge can we activate to build upon?"*

### 4. **Casual Mentor** - Active Learning & Discovery
- **Methodology**: Analogical reasoning, experiential learning, guided discovery
- **Teaching Style**: Real-world examples, student-driven exploration
- **Example**: *"Let's think about this together. What's your intuition telling you? Often your first instinct points us in the right direction."*

## üìö Evidence-Based Teaching Principles

All mentor types incorporate:
- **Socratic Method**: Asking questions to guide learning
- **Scaffolding**: Building from simple to complex concepts
- **Active Learning**: Engaging students in the learning process
- **Metacognition**: Explicit modeling of thinking processes
- **Formative Assessment**: Checking understanding before progressing
- **Growth Mindset**: Encouraging effort and recognizing progress

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **AI API**: Google Gemini for language generation
- **Database**: SQLite for data persistence
- **Logging**: Structured logging with context

## üìä Features Demonstrated

1. **Style Analysis**: "Analyze My Style" button shows communication pattern analysis
2. **Live Demo**: "Show Style Mimicking Demo" demonstrates the system in action
3. **Event Simulation**: Python and Math exam simulation with nudge generation
4. **Session Management**: Create and manage chat sessions
5. **Analytics**: Message counts and engagement tracking

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- Environment variables for API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging for monitoring
- Clean, documented code structure

## üìù Assumptions Made

1. **Mentor Style Learning**: Uses sample messages to learn communication patterns
2. **Context Window**: Maintains conversation history for better responses
3. **Event Simulation**: Provides exam simulation for testing nudge generation
4. **Direct Responses**: AI generates responses without approval workflow for simplicity
