# AI Agent Intern - Technical Assessment Solution

**Communication Style Mimicking Agent for Mentor-Student Messaging System**

This project implements an AI agent that learns from and replicates user communication patterns in a mentor-student messaging context, as specified in the technical assessment requirements.

## 🎯 Assessment Requirements Met

### ✅ Core Requirements
1. **Style Mimicking Agent** - Analyzes mentor's communication patterns and generates authentic responses
2. **Context-Aware Responses** - Uses conversation history to provide relevant, helpful replies
3. **Event-Based Nudges** - Proactive follow-up messages based on student events

### ✅ Nice-to-Have Features
- **Event Tracking** - Simulates student events (exams, assignments)
- **Proactive Messaging** - Contextual follow-up messages in mentor's style
- **Professional Implementation** - Clean, maintainable code with comprehensive logging

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Set up environment**
```bash
cp env.example .env
# Add your GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
```

3. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main Streamlit application with UI
- `agents.py` - AI agent functions for style analysis and response generation
- `database.py` - SQLite database operations for sessions and styles
- `logging_config.py` - Comprehensive logging system
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## 🧠 Technical Approach

### Style Analysis Process
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes mentor's tone, vocabulary, message structure
2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifies common phrases, emoji usage, punctuation style
3. **Style Modeling**: Creates a communication fingerprint for the mentor
4. **Response Generation**: Uses learned patterns to generate authentic responses

### Context-Aware Response Generation
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple messages
- **Style Consistency**: Ensures responses match mentor's established patterns
- **Educational Value**: Provides helpful, accurate information in mentor's style

### Event-Based Nudging System
- **Event Simulation**: Tests scenarios like exam completion
- **Proactive Messaging**: Generates contextual follow-up messages
- **Style Integration**: Nudges match mentor's communication style

## 🎭 Style Mimicking Example

**Mentor's Communication Style:**
- Tone: Casual and encouraging
- Common phrases: "Hey!", "So basically", "No worries", "You got this!"
- Emoji usage: Frequent (👍, 😅, 💪, 😊, 🎯)
- Teaching approach: Step-by-step with examples

**Student Message:**
> "I'm having trouble understanding recursion. Can you help?"

**AI Response (mimicking mentor's style):**
> "Hey! No worries, recursion can be tricky at first 😊 So basically, think of it like a function calling itself. Start with simple examples like factorial - that'll help you get the concept. Don't stress, you'll get it with practice! 💪"

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: Streamlit for web interface
- **AI API**: Google Gemini for language generation

2. **Live Demo**: "Show Style Mimicking Demo" demonstrates the system in action
3. **Event Simulation**: Python and Math exam simulation with nudge generation
4. **Session Management**: Create and manage chat sessions
5. **Analytics**: Message counts and engagement tracking

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

- Environment variables for API keys
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging for monitoring
- Clean, documented code structure

## 📝 Assumptions Made

1. **Mentor Style Learning**: Uses sample messages to learn communication patterns
2. **Context Window**: Maintains conversation history for better responses
3. **Event Simulation**: Provides exam simulation for testing nudge generation
4. **Direct Responses**: AI generates responses without approval workflow for simplicity
